# gbs-control-atmega

This project provides control software for Tvia Trueview5725 based video converter boards.
These boards are a cost efficient way to adapt legacy game consoles to modern displays.

Gbs-control-atmega replaces the original control software and better optimizes the Trueview5725 multimedia processor for the task of upscaling "240p/288p" 15kHz content on 4:3, 5:4 and 16:10 displays.

It is a arduino-only fork of "gbs-control" from rama, secifically made for modern widescreen displays, including overscan, external Buttons etc.
